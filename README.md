# Karma
This module adds a Karma system to your HumHub installation.

## Installation
Karma hasn't yet been added to the HumHub market place, so for the time being, you will need to install it manually. Don't worry, it's not as hard as it sounds!

- Clone the karma module into your modules directory
```
cd protected/modules
git clone https://github.com/ConnectedCommunities/humhub-modules-karma.git karma
```

- Go to Admin > Modules. You should now see the Karma module in your list of installed modules

-  Click "Enable". This will install the Karma module for you
